This repo contains projects where I've built processing workflows and bots for WikiData. I've started this via my favored platform for capturing notes and code, Jupyter Notebook. You'll find the following projects in this space:

* ecoregions - Processing code and documentation for processing EPA Ecoregion data (3 datasets for North America and 2 for CONUS) into WikiData items, following a modeling pattern already set for two of these cases.
