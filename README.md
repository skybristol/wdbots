# wdbots
This repo contains projects where I've built processing workflows and bots for WikiData. I've started this via my favored platform for capturing notes and code, Jupyter Notebook. You'll find the following projects in this space:

* ecoregions - Processing code and documentation for processing EPA Ecoregion data (3 datasets for North America and 2 for CONUS) into WikiData items, following a modeling pattern already set for two of these cases.

## Environment
The environment.yml file contains a working view of the Python environment used in these projects. Not all projects need everything in the initial "wdbots" environment, so I may split things out over time depending on what all gets built here.
